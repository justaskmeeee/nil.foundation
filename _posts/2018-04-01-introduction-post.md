## What is =nil; Foundation?

[=nil; Foundation](https://nil.foundation) was established in April of 2018 
to facilitate cryptography and databases research and development.

## =nil; Foundation Initiatives

Foundation supports projects which are established by the Foundation itself and
ones established by third-parties as well.

Initial set of projects supported by the Foundation contains:
* [=nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite](https://github.com/nilfoundation/crypto3) 
created by Foundation's [=nil; Crypto3](https://crypto3.nil.foundation) cryptography 
team
* [=nil; 'DROP DATABASE *](https://dbms.nil.foundation) 
created by Foundation's [=nil; Database](https://database3.nil.foundation) team


### =nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite

Cryptography suite project was established to provide architecturally elegant
and efficient modern cryptography primitives implementation along with more
tranditional constructions implemented in the same way. Crypto3 suite eventually 
became the foundation for all cryptography research and development within the
Foundation, reducing security risks of misimplementation or a design flaw.

### =nil; `DROP DATABASE *

`=nil; 'DROP DATABASE *` is a database management system capable of working with
currently exising protocol as with regular databases, providing them with
traditional DBMS features:
* Query language (declarative SQL-alike and imperative one).
* Protocol state partitioning. Allows to reduce protocol deployment and
    maintenance costs.
* Cross-database queries. Allows to manage the data within different databases.
* Database-level replication protocol implementation. Allows to replicate
    databases with very different replication protocols to the same DBMS
    instance.

## =nil; Foundation Teams

Being an R&D non-profit means to have associated teams to carry the expertise and
perform the actual research. That is why [=nil; Foundation](https://nil.foundation) 
has several associated teams which help to facilitate the results.

### =nil; Crypto3 Team

To handle all the R&D happening around =nil; Crypto3 Cryptography Suite, a
cryptography-dedicated [=nil; Crypto3](https://crypto3.nil.foundation) team was 
established. It's interests vary from applied compexity-theory research and 
cryptography schemes constructions and implementations development to
cryptography and protocol security audits. More on that can be noticed at
https://crypto3.nil.foundation/.

### =nil; Database Team

Database team was established to facilitate `=nil; 'DROP DATABASE *` R&D. It's
particular functionality beings with the DBMS core development (replication
protocol interfaces standartization, query language changes, data storage layer
implementation) to developing initial set of applications and replication
protocols (e.g. Bitcoin-family replication protocol adapter).
