## What is this about?

This post covers one of the applications of a [=nil; 'DROP DATABASE *](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/12/01/database-management-system.html)-based [Trustless Data Accessibility protocol](https://blog.nil.foundation/2022/05/31/dbms-replication-protocol.html) - trustless bridging. In particular, it covers an integration with
[Mina Protocol](https://minaprotocol.com), for which we've already
[described](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/09/30/mina-ethereum-bridge.html),
[developed](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/11/01/mina-ethereum-bridge-design.html)
and [demoed](https://twitter.com/nil_foundation/status/1519217326679277569?s=21&t=cO_rYkedp2iIoekhh9DbQg)
a one-directional bridge.

## Alright. Let's read your story.

In the end of April 2022 Mina Protocol's in-EVM state verification finally saw
the light of the day [https://verify.mina.nil.foundation](https://verify.mina.nil.foundation).
Meanwhile, <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>
Foundation wasn't sitting idle and
[announced](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/12/01/database-management-system.html)
a <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span> Database Management System
called <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil; 'DROP DATABASE *</span>
and [its replication protocol extension](https://blog.nil.foundation/2022/05/31/dbms-replication-protocol.html)
which is capable of providing trustless I/O to various databases through the DBMS's
query language unified for all the databases (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Mina,
others).

## And how is this relevant?

=nil; provides users (no matter what kind of users -
applications or protocols) with on-demand state and query proofs for three different
use cases:
1. **Trustless Data Access.** If a proof consumer is an end-user application or
   a frontend of any kind, it could be used for accessing data on the protocol
   that it lives on.
2. **Trustless Bridging.** If a proof consumer is a protocol (e.g. Mina), and a
   user of this protocol requested a state/query proof of another protocol
   (e.g. Ethereum or Solana), it could be used for trustless bridging of these
   two protocols.
3. **Pluggable Scaling.** If a proof consumer is a protocol and its user (an
   application or otherwise) it is of the same kind a user has requested a
   state/query proof from (e.g. some Avalanche user has requested a state/query
   proof of another independent, application-specific Avalanche deployment), then
   it results into increasing the throughput of the original protocol cluster
   deployment.

In this article, we’ll be describing the second use case applied to Mina.

## Okay. Haven’t you already done this? What’s so new about it?

Not so fast. What we’ve accomplished so far is a one-directional Mina-Ethereum
bridge core (which is effectively an in-EVM Mina state transition verification).

Application examples of a currently existing single-directional in-EVM Kimchi
proof verification are:
1. Proving that a particular trade order was filled on Uniswap with Mina without revealing the actual trade
2. Proving the location with Mina with some transfer happening on Ethereum afterward
3. Proving the identity with Mina and using it as a second factor to the Ethereum-based action authorization
4. Others, you name it.

More detailed overview of a currently existing solution can be found in previous
relevant blog posts: [https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/11/01/mina-ethereum-bridge-design.html](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/11/01/mina-ethereum-bridge-design.html),
[https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/09/30/mina-ethereum-bridge.html](https://blog.nil.foundation/2021/09/30/mina-ethereum-bridge.html).

The most important thing that the =nil; brings is the capability to fetch
state and query proofs for various other protocols (like Ethereum, Solana or
Avalance). And, since we can switch the proof system being used within
<span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>, those query
and state proofs can be bridged to any supported proof system. In Mina’s case
specifically, we generate the proofs in Kimchi.

This specification allows us to verify third-party protocol data proofs directly
within Mina, which leads us to...

## Mina Bi-Directional Bridging!

Yes!

Let’s break this process down step-by-step.

1. First of all, we need a state proof for the third-party protocol we want to
   bridge to Mina, generated in the Placeholder proof system, and wrapped
   in a Kimchi proof. Let’s say this third-party protocol is Ethereum (but in
   reality, it could be any protocol supported by
   <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>). So the user or
   application wanting to bridge Ethereum data to Mina has to retrieve this proof
   from <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>.
2. Next, submit the retrieved proof to the Mina verifier. From Mina’s perspective,
   a <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>-generated
   data proof will be identical to a native Mina's zkApp-generated proof.
   A <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>-flavored
   Mina's zkApp, if you will.
3. After the proof is submitted to the Mina verifier, the user (or Mina-based
   application) receives the relevant Ethereum data - and voila! Ethereum's data
   is being safely and trustlessly used in Mina.

## What about other protocols?

Other protocols, supported by <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>
are also going to be available for Mina-compatible state/query proof generation
and retrieval. For example, Solana's integration is on its way.

Same process as for Ethereum from user story side:
1. Retrieve a state/query proof with Solana's data generated with Placeholder
   and wrapped with Kimchi proof system from <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>.
2. Submit such a proof to Mina's native verifier just like you would do with a
   Snapp's proof.
3. Feel free and safe to use Solana's data within the Snapp.

## And a data proof from a combination of protocols?

Yes! It is a DBMS which supplies <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>
with data, remember?

So, in case a user wants to bridge Solana's and Ethereum, the only adjustment to
the user story would be to retrieve a proof of a composite query from
<span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span> with something
like: `SELECT FROM SOLANA WHERE a EQUALS b; SELECT FROM ETHEREUM WHERE
c EQUALS d`. Then <span style='font-family:Menlo, Courier, monospace'>=nil;</span>
would return a proof of such a query generated in Placeholder proof system and
wrapped with Kimchi, which will be okay for Mina's native verifier, so one can
safely use other protocols data in Mina.

## Sold. When?

According to our best estimates, we plan to introduce the first working prototype
of Ethereum’s state/query proof generator compatible with Mina’s proof system in
Q4 2022.

## Stay tuned!
